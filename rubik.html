<p align="center"> Takes a mixture of skill and determination for anyone to solve the cube on their own. And the nice thing about the cube is, it's a puzzle with no hidden information.  Everything is right there in the open and it's all about observation, experiments, noticing patterns, etc. Although it takes determination, there is absolutely no luck involved in solving the cube. one obvious benefit of solving the cube on your own is that if you have any doubts you'd be a good engineer, computer programmer or science guy in general; solving the cube should alleviate those doubts. Conversation starter (anywhere, anytime)...bring out a cube and show people that you can solve in 30 seconds or so (even though that's a lousy time by today's standards) and I guarantee you'll start-up a conversation (even in Job interviews it works).
Pride of accomplishment.
Optimism - most day-to-day personal problems are easier to solve than solving a Rubik's cube (especially if you remember that day-to-day problems are not necessarily "puzzles to solve").
