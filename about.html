takes a mixture of skill and determination for anyone to solve the cube on their own. And the nice thing about the cube is, it's a puzzle with no hidden information.  Everything is right there in the open and it's all about observation, experiments, noticing patterns, etc... Although it takes determination, there is absolutely no luck involved in solving the cube. one obvious benefit of solving the cube on your own is that if you have any doubts you'd be a good engineer, computer programmer or science guy in general; solving the cube should alleviate those doubts. Conversation starter (anywhere, anytime)...bring out a cube and show people that you can solve in 30 seconds or so (even though that's a lousy time by today's standards) and I guarantee you'll start-up a conversation (even in Job interviews it works).
Pride of accomplishment.
Optimism - most day-to-day personal problems are easier to solve than solving a Rubik's cube (especially if you remember that day-to-day problems are not necessarily "puzzles to solve").

Fidget spinner
 A fidget spinner is a flat, two- or three-pronged, ball-bearing toy that you rotate between your fingers to make it a spin.Using Fidget spinners is one of the ways to help relieve stress and cope with anxiety and ADHD. Fidgeting is the act of moving about restlessly, often as a result of nervousness, impatience, or boredom. Experts have suggested that fidgeting is associated with the level of stimulation we receive. If something is not able to hold our attention, fidgeting increases attentiveness by distracting the part of the brain that is ‘bored’ in order to allow the other parts to focus. Fidgeting is also a natural response that helps manage high levels of stress.A Fidget Spinner is diffidently a useful toy to have to relieve stress. Here are some reasons you should get a Fidget Spinner.
•	Fidget Spinners are Fun!
•	Fidget Spinners are affordable
•	Fidget Spinners help you relax
•	Fidget Spinners help you concentrate
•	Fidget Spinners can help kids with ADHD

Scalp massager
Like with a body massage, a head massage has been shown to be a very effective stress reliever.  The muscles of the head, shoulders, neck, and even the back become very relaxed and loose.  Both chronic and acute headaches, and even feelings of depression and anxiety can sometimes be alleviated with regular head massage.
If you have trouble sleeping, consider getting a head and scalp massage.  Increasing blood circulation to the scalp can also help prevent flakiness and dryness of the scalp, and adds to the hair’s luster by spreading its natural oil.  This can also prevent the hair from excessive shedding, and can help prevent split ends.  A head massage promotes the growth of new hair, and adds strength to the existing hair by nourishing the hair shafts. 
Head massage techniques are very important; your masseuse or hair specialist will be well trained in neck, face, shoulder, and head massage methods.  The basic technique is to apply the correct amount of pressure on the head using fingers and thumbs.  Fists and knuckles may also be used.  Oil can be used on the fingers to keep from pulling on the hair, and to nourish the scalp.  The massage should cover the sides, back, and top of the head.  Gentle kneading, pulling, wringing, and gliding strokes are used for instant relaxation.  Pressure can be firm or light and gentle.  The muscles of the face should be included in the massage; pressure applied to the cheeks, eyebrows and around the eye sockets are also relaxing.

Toysmith deluxe zen garden
Zen gardens are one of the most breathtaking sights you’ll ever see. These special areas were originally created in Japan to assist Zen Buddhist monks with daily meditation and introspection. Monks raked the sand every day to maintain its distinct pattern and discourage vegetation growth. They would also spend time in a specific spot in the garden to observe, reflect and meditate. Although we may not have the time and space to create and maintain a traditional zen garden, we can still engage in this practice and reap the benefits with our own mini zen gardens.
Many people like to keep tabletop zen gardens on their work desks to take a mindfulness break during the day while others like to display them in living areas to give guests a tranquil activity to do. Raking patterns in the sand and rearranging rocks helps increase mindfulness, making mini zen gardens a great activity to unwind during times of stress and doubt, or even periods of success. Engaging in these activities is a great way to clear our minds and reflect on our thoughts.
Stress balls
Stress balls are small balls or objects filled with a malleable gel or clay that are held in the palm of your hand. The act of repeatedly squeezing the ball releases tension and helps to relieve stress. The benefits of stress balls also include boosting blood circulation and helping with the treatment of carpal-tunnel syndrome -- and they're used as a tool for meditation. The balls can also be used as a physical therapy tool to help strengthen the muscles of the hand and wrist. Consult with a physician before treating stress or injuries on your own. Decreasing stress and tension can help to improve the quality of your life by promoting better sleep, warding off illness and enhancing a general feeling of well-being. Squeezing the ball activates the muscles of your hand and wrist; releasing the grip allows the muscles to relax. The repeated pattern of grip and release helps to alleviate tension and stress.
