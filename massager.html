<p align="center"> with a body massage, a head massage has been shown to be a very effective stress reliever.  The muscles of the head, shoulders, neck, and even the back become very relaxed and loose.  Both chronic and acute headaches, and even feelings of depression and anxiety can sometimes be alleviated with regular head massage.
If you have trouble sleeping, consider getting a head and scalp massage.  Increasing blood circulation to the scalp can also help prevent flakiness and dryness of the scalp, and adds to the hair’s luster by spreading its natural oil.  This can also prevent the hair from excessive shedding, and can help prevent split ends.  A head massage promotes the growth of new hair, and adds strength to the existing hair by nourishing the hair shafts. 
Head massage techniques are very important; your masseuse or hair specialist will be well trained in neck, face, shoulder, and head massage methods.  The basic technique is to apply the correct amount of pressure on the head using fingers and thumbs.  Fists and knuckles may also be used.  Oil can be used on the fingers to keep from pulling on the hair, and to nourish the scalp.  The massage should cover the sides, back, and top of the head.  Gentle kneading, pulling, wringing, and gliding strokes are used for instant relaxation.  Pressure can be firm or light and gentle.
